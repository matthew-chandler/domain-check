## Live Site

You can access a live version of the site [here](domains.machandler.com).

## How to use

Simply enter in a list of domains you want the availability for, and the page will check and returns which of the entered domains are available for registration. It also checks for domains shortened by further dividing the [SLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain) into SLD and TLD (e.g. today.com -> to.day).

Since the [domainr API](https://domainr.com/) has a [limited free tier](https://rapidapi.com/domainr/api/domainr/pricing), users are limited to 50 requests per day.
